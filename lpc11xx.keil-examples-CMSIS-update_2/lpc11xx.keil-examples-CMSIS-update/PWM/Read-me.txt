Purpose:
This example implements Pulse Width Modulation Test modules on LPC11xx

* Tested on Keil MCB1000 

Running mode:
* Compile, Flash the program and reset.

Notes:
Utilizing the PWM on LPC11xx, a specified GPIO bit (LED) is switched ON/OFF.
The duty cycle can be controlled as desired.

Output:
Observe PWM signals on 
*CT32B_1 MAT 0/PIO1_1 with Freq 12KHz Duty cycle 75%.
*CT16B_0 MAT 1/PIO1_10 Freq 12KHz Duty cycle 50%.
*PIO2_0 toggles continuosly.

Specs:
PWM frequency used = 48KHz
